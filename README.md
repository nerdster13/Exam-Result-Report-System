Computer Graphics Program in C++ for Student Report Card System

This is a Student report card system. It can store the details of the student's data and his/her marks. All this data is saved into a file and can be viewed even after restarting the application.

This Application makes use of the TurboC Software which can be downloaded from https://www.developerinsider.in/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/.

After Downloading the Software and the Files from this git, change the path in the STUDENT.CPP file on the initgraph() function on line 104. This needs to be the path of the BGI folder inside the TurboC Software.
